    * Use a `%` or `ðŸ’¬` at the beginning of a line to indicate the topic is public
  * Private thread remain private, but are synchronised
    * Uses discourse's `unlisted`
    * Without syntax, private is assumed
* Comments
  * Public comments in linked threads get synchronised
    * Use a `%` or `ðŸ’¬` at the beginning of a line to indicate the comment is public
  * Private comments remain private, but are synchronised
    * Uses discourse's `whisper`
    * Uses front's `comment`
